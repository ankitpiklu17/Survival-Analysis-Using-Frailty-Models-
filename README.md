# Survival-Analysis-Using-Frailty-Models-

This project delves into the parametric analysis of bivariate right censored data through
the application of frailty models. 

Frailty, which captures the unobserved heterogeneity within a population, is a key aspect of our analysis. 
Differing from conventional methods, this study does not include any covariate effects. 
We have generated bivariate right censored data, specifically using gamma frailty models with a Weibull baseline hazard.
This approach enables a comprehensive examination of the underlying frailty and its influence
on the competing risks present in the data. 

The results offer valuable insights into the nature and consequences of unobserved heterogeneity in the 
context of bivariate right censored data.
